Welcome to my Netflix Data Science Capstone project! This analysis dives into the rich dataset of Netflix's content to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights using Python and data visualization libraries.

## 📌 Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix's content dataset, identifying:
- Content trends over time
- Most popular genres and countries
- Ratings distribution
- Duration insights (Movies vs. TV Shows)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset**, containing information like:
- Title, Genre, Type (Movie/TV Show)
- Country, Rating, Duration
- Release year and date added to the platform

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – for visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive analysis

## 📊 Key Findings
- 📈 Rapid increase in content post-2016
- 🎭 Dramas, Comedies, and Documentaries are most common
- 🌍 The USA leads in content count, followed by India and others
- ⌛ Majority of TV Shows span multiple seasons while Movies have varied durations

## 📎 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed messy date and duration columns
- Created visualizations for genre popularity, yearly trends, and more
- Comparative analysis between Movies and TV Shows
